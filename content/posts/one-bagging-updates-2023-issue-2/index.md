### Choosing the Right Bag for One-Bagging

Choosing the right bag is important for effective one-bagging. The best bags for one-bag travel are lightweight, versatile, and long-lasting. A member expressed a concern about his own backpack which had a manufacturing issue. After contacting the company, he was sent a new backpack free of charge under warranty. The post received comments from other members who shared their positive experiences with the brand along with questions about the manufacturer’s sustainability practices seeing that it did not last until warranty. The bag was a Cotopaxi which he used for two years travelling across California, Mexico, Sri Lanka, among others. See the discussion here, [Thank you Cotopaxi! Free bag replacement under warranty](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/12ncbb0/thank_you_cotopaxi_free_bag_replacement_under/).

A contributor also shared thoughts on the prevalence of the Osprey Farpoint 40 backpack among one-bag travellers. ​​Some contributors expressed scepticism about the backpack's prevalence, intrigued wondering if it was because of aggressive marketing tactics rather than its actual performance. Others defended the backpack's reputation, owing to their personal positive experiences with it and the high ratings it has received from reputable reviewers. The most important factor when choosing a bag is to consider the type of trip you are planning, the length of your stay, and the items you will need to bring with you. Choose a bag with plenty of compartments and organisational features to keep your belongings neat and easy to access. See the discussion here, [I feel like the Osprey marketing team is on this subreddit, suggesting and upvoting the Farpoint 40](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/130xdty/i_feel_like_the_osprey_marketing_team_is_on_this/).


### Packing Tips and Tricks for One-Bag Travel

In a Reddit post [8 Months of traveling South-america 40L](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1390caq/8_months_of_traveling_southamerica_40l/), a participant shared their experience of efficiently one-bagging an eight(8)-month trip through South America with a 40 L backpack. This allowed them to navigate their journey smoothly, eliminating the hassle of checking in additional luggage at airports. The participant offered valuable tips on efficient packing, including the use of packing cubes and rolling clothes to maximise space. Despite carrying electronic devices such as a Kindle and a camera, they maintained a minimalist approach to their packing. Furthermore, the participant emphasised the importance of adaptability and flexibility to unexpected situations. Being prepared to adjust plans and stay open-minded can greatly enhance the overall experience. It is crucial to remain mindful of airline restrictions on liquids and other items. By following these guidelines, travellers can minimise potential hassles and enjoy a more streamlined journey.


### Dressing for Success: Packing Light for Any Climate

Regardless of whether you are travelling to a hot or cold climate, one-bagging requires careful consideration of materials you will need to stay comfortable. Invest in garments that will help you stay prepared for any weather. Provide lightweight, breathable clothing for hot climates and opt for wool or fleece for colder destinations. A fellow member packed minimal and lightweight clothing, including merino wool underwear, wool t-shirts, and a waterproof jacket to account for varying temperatures and weather conditions. He also carried a book, a smartphone, and a small toiletry bag. The fellow realised the 15 L backpack to be convenient and comfortable for the trip, allowing him to move around easily without worrying about heavy luggage. He also emphasised that the small size of the backpack helped him pack only the essentials, avoiding overpacking. See the discussion here, [15 L, two weeks in Switzerland and Italy, -2°C to 22°C](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/12w49vs/15_l_two_weeks_in_switzerland_and_italy_2c_to_22c/).

In a Reddit post [One-bag for 2 weeks in Europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1388g6t/onebag_for_2_weeks_in_europe/), another fellow member shared their experience of one-bagging for a two(2)-week trip in Europe. They used a 35 L backpack and packed versatile clothing items such as merino wool shirts and pants, a lightweight down jacket, and a pair of comfortable walking shoes. They also included travel essentials such as a microfiber towel, a universal power adapter, and a water bottle. They managed their laundry once during their trip, which was convenient and easy due to the quick-drying properties of their clothing.


### Challenges and Benefits of One-Bagging as a Tourist

A user concerned the challenge of maintaining a non-touristy appearance while practising one-bagging during travel. This is because tourists often become easy targets for theft or scams, making it necessary to blend in with the local surroundings for a safer travel experience. One-bagging can contribute to achieving this by enabling a minimalist and practical wardrobe that aligns with the local culture and climate. The advantages of not looking like a tourist encompass the ability to immerse oneself in a more authentic travel experience and being treated as a local by the locals. Additionally, it can lead to potential cost savings, as vendors may be less inclined to overcharge someone who appears to be a local resident. See the discussion here, [Not looking like a tourist](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/134c5jl/not_looking_like_a_tourist/).


### Challenges and Benefits of One-Bagging as a Family

In a Reddit post [Family of three, onebagging in Japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/12xozab/we_47m_and_48f_took_our_youngest_14f_to_japan_for/), a member pointed out that we can learn several things as a family that practises one-bagging. Alot ample time to plan packing lists and choose versatile clothing items that can be mixed and matched. Also make sure to bring essential items for specific activities, such as swimwear and hiking shoes. Use packing cubes to organise belongings within the single backpack, making it easier to find what is needed and keep their bag tidy. The family was able to travel comfortably and efficiently with just one backpack per person, without worrying about bulky luggage. They were also able to save money on baggage fees and avoid the hassle of waiting for checked luggage at the airport. Overall, we can learn that with careful planning, efficient packing techniques, and a willingness to embrace a minimalist travel lifestyle, families can successfully practise one-bagging and enjoy the many benefits that come with it.
