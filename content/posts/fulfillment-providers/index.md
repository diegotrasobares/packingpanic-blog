Lean startup theory says, when starting a new business you should focus on the very core that differentiates your business from others and outsource everything else. Since we start our business with an online shop, we need to set up a warehouse and pack and ship parcels. This is called fulfillment. There are tons of fulfillment providers popping up in Europe. So fulfillment seemed to be an easy thing to outsource, it seemed. Here is a review of early experiences negotiating with fulfillment providers.

## What fulfillment providers want to know

We have not sold a single product yet. However, fulfillment providers want to know the monthly rate of packages that you send out. What number should I say? Maybe we will send out 50 parcels in the first month, because we are still testing the process. Maybe we will send out 500 parcels per month by the end of the year. Who knows that number? Since I am German I put some conservatively low number that I found is reachable in the second or third month. However, it is still a wild guess.

Other things fulfillment providers want to know:

- What kind of products do you sell
- Do you sell potentially hazardous goods? Do goods contain batteries?
- Any liquids?
- Any perishable goods
- Minimum and maximum sizes and weight
- How are the products packaged? Are they packaged at all?
- Are the products labelled with a barcode?

Since our product catalog covers everything for travelling it spans multiple verticals from cosmetics and electronics to luggage. The product dimensions
cover a broad range from a nail clipper  up to the dimensions of a cabin lagguage suitcase.

## The thresholds to pass

Fulfillment providers need packaged and labelled products and expect that you send out at least around 250 monthly packages per month. However, instead of saying that right away, some of the fulfillment providers let you fill out forms and then reject you because the products are not labelled and they can only handle labelled products.

## Fulfillment Prcing

The typical quote from a fulfillment provider has the following price points:

- Cost per pick
- Sequential pick cost
- Cost per order, sometimes including the first pick
- Cost of packaging
- Cost for delivery
- Cost of storage space

Most providers offer to work with their contracts with delivery providers instead of with your own contract. This way they also earn money from the delivery cost and have negotiating power with the delivery providers. Some providers offer an "optimized delivery", they will choose the cheapest delivery provider on their contract.

The quoted price per pick ranged from 70 Cents to 1.60 Euros. Depending on their strategy providers try to earn more or less with these different costs. When comparing providers, it is important to calculate a total monthly estimate and not just compare the picking cost. Still, the comparison falls short. If a provider has a tiny bigger picking error rate, it may cost a lot more in the end than the cheaper alternative with the lower rates.

## Hub or shared storage organization?

Fulfillment providers have different ways to organize their warehouses. The basic distinction is between a shared storage for all customers or a hub-based model that concentrates all goods of one customer in one place in the warehouse. Depending on the model there are different ways to optimize the picking process.

The hub based model offers lower picking costs but is not a good fit for bigger products. The shared storage is has higher picking costs but has lower storage costs. As soon as we want to sell bag packs and suitcases the hub based model does not work any more, because the products are two big and require lots of storage space.

## Zenfulfillment

The communication with Zenfulfillment was very smooth from the beginning. Information is well structured well and readily available. I would have liked to work with them, however, they don't offer a hub-based model, which is a better fit for most of our products and in the long run would reduce picking costs. Many thanks Nuri to for the helpful tips!

## Byrd

Unfortunately, my guess of monthly shipments did not pass their threshold to have a talk. Maybe that is good in the end. Less talking, more time to do other things. For more information go the [Byrd Homepage](https://wwww.packingpanic.com/go/www.getbyrd.com?utm_source=papablog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=fulfillment1). For starting Byrd suggested 
their partner [Sendgrid](https://wwww.packingpanic.com/to/sendgrid.com?utm_source=papablog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=fulfillment1) which is offering an API to delivery providers, return labels, tracking pages, etc.

## Huboo

Huboo seemed like a good fit for us, because they organize the warehouse in a hub model and offer lowest picking costs. The customer contact is friendly and competent. Occording to huboo, integration with our planed shop system (PrestShop) is only a matter of minutes and no problem. Great, I thought, let's try them. The onboarding process started with frustration. They send a 
detailed questionaire about company data and product catalog. It took me several hours to fill out the form because of technical problems. At the end of the process I found at least three reproducible bugs in the huboos's form. I tried with two different browsers. Since it turned into 2023, the customer representative informed me that, starting in 2023, there is now a minimum monthly rate of 500 Euros. At the end, the inital experience was not pleasent. Important information was only send step by step. You need to call them multiple times for clarifications. Due to technical problems with huboo's form I wasted several hours of my life. For more information go the [Huboo Homepage](https://wwww.packingpanic.com/go/www.huboo.com?utm_source=papablog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=fulfillment1).

## Lufapak

Lufapak offers also the hub setup. When negotiating with the sales team we got told, that Lufapak has a hub solution, but they are still waiting for the first customer for it. We should contact them again, when we have more shipment volume, however, although I asked, I did not get a number which volume they expect. I am not sure whether the Lufapak hub really exists or not. Go to [Lufapak Hub LÃ¶sung - German](https://wwww.packingpanic.com/go/www.lufapak.de/hub-loesung/?utm_source=papablog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=fulfillment1) to see how Lufapak is marketing their new hub product. I am happy to get more infomration about customer experiences with Lufapak.

## Warehousing1

When filling their form I guessed a reasonable shipment number for the first month. So I put in 100 in their form. With that number the volme did not pass their threshold of 250 per month so I got a friendly mail saying exactly that. Anyhow, I hope to keep in contact since Wahrehousing1 is investing a lot in quality standards and sustainable operation. So it seems a good fit with our DNA. Interesting: Since I made the initial request they changed their request form and ask now for an expected yearly volume if you tick less then 250 shipments per month. Well done! Let's talk again! Look up the [Warehousing1 home page](https://wwww.packingpanic.com/go/www.warehousing1.com?utm_source=papablog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=fulfillment1) to get an idea yourself.

## My conclusion

I learned a bit about the fulfillment provider landscape in Germany and Europe. But there is also a lot of frustration. Fulfillment providers require that all products are packaged and labelled. This will add cost overhead and produces more packaging waste for some products. Using a fulfillment provider is a good fit, e.g. for D2C brands with a small product range and prices of 30 Euros and up. In our case, we will have a lot of tiny, low-priced products in our product portfolio (soap bottles, nail clippers, pack sacks). Doing efficient fulfillment for tiny products is a challenge that no fulfillment provider can solve at the moment.

Although all providers market with the term "for startups", the interesting discovery is: No one is willing to send out the first parcel to your very first customer! Before using a fulfillment provider, I need to hire warehouse staff or pick and pack by myself. Is that true fulfillment? My recommendation to fulfillment providers: Have an offering for startup businesses with a ramp-up plan with a certain target to reach in a year. OTOH, as a startup founder, it is a good idea to put in expected yearly averages in the form to pass the initial barrier.

Maybe using a fulfillment provider does not work for our range of products. We will start with a small warehouse by ourselves to get some initial experience.
