As a frequent traveller, I've tried many different strategies for packing my luggage efficiently and staying organised on the road. Recently, I completed two different types of travel, a 2 two-month backpacking around South East Asia and a 30-day cycling trip.

One tool that has become most valuable in my packing routine is packing cubes. I got three different sizes of packing cubes from a friend and have been using them since then. Here is what I learned during my last trips.

## The Benefits

I found packing cubes especially useful during my cycling trip and backpacking adventure with just one bag. Here are some of the ways that packing cubes made my travels easier and more organized:

When you're packing for an extended trip with limited space, every centimetre counts. Packing cubes allowed me to maximize the space in my luggage by compressing clothes and eliminating air pockets. I felt it was helping a lot during my cycling trip, where I had to carry all of my gear on my bike.

During my backpacking trip, I changed cities and countries very often. Once I arrived at an accommodation, I usually went straight away to do sightseeing in the cuty. With packing cubes, I could easily group my items by category. This made it quicker and easier to pack and unpack my luggage.

I had several unpleasant experiences before using Packing Cubes during travelling, sometimes my clothes got mixed up or lost in my luggage. With everything organized in packing cubes, I didn't have to worry about it. It was a blessing to use packing cubes, where I could access my gear quickly and efficiently.

## The Challenges

While I found packing cubes to be a valuable tool during my travels, there were some challenges that I encountered: It can be difficult to find the right size packing cube for certain items. I had to experiment with different sizes to find the right fit for all of my gear. While packing cubes can help you maximize space in your luggage, they do add some extra weight. This was noticeable during my cycling trip, where every ounce counted. Depending on how you pack your cubes, it can be difficult to access certain items without unpacking everything. So it is essential to keep this in mind during packing so it would not be an issue.

## Final Thoughts

Packing cubes help you to keep your luggage organized and make packing simpler. On the other finding the best fitting packing cube can be a challenge. Nevertheless, I wholeheartedly recommend packing cubes to any traveller who wants to maintain organisation while out and about.
